Name: 김지민 (Kim Jimin)\nAge: 42\nGender: Female\nVocation: Indie Game Developer\n\nBackground:\nKim Jimin had a lucrative career in software engineering at a major tech company in the city. However, the corporate culture and constant pressure took a toll on her mental and physical health. Deciding to pursue her passion for creating video games, she moved to a small, peaceful village to work as an indie game developer. Despite her dreams, she often feels worn out and struggles to manage her work-life balance.\n\nLooks:\nJimin has short, dark hair that she often ties back into a simple ponytail. She wears rectangular glasses that give her a sharp, focused look. Her attire is practical and comfortable, often consisting of loose sweaters and jeans. She frequently looks tired with slight dark circles under her eyes, but her expressive eyes hint at a deep intellect.\n\nFeature:\nJimin's most distinctive feature is a small, silver pendant shaped like a game controller that she always wears around her neck. It’s a token of her leap of faith into the world of indie game development.\n\nCharacter:\nJimin is highly rational and logical, often favoring data and evidence over intuition and emotion. Her introverted nature means she prefers quiet environments and deep, meaningful conversations, though those are rare due to her lack of social engagement. While she can come off as aloof or unfeeling, she genuinely cares about the people close to her — she just struggles to express it.\n\nSpecialty:\nJimin excels in game design mechanics and coding. Her games often receive praise for their intricate puzzles and innovative gameplay, reflecting her logical thinking and attention to detail.\n\nHobby:\nIn her free time, Jimin loves exploring various genres of video games, old and new. She finds comfort in meticulously tending to her small vegetable garden, where she grows mainly eggplants and cauliflower, her favorite vegetables. She also enjoys reading science fiction novels.\n\nObjective:\nJimin's primary objective is to create a successful indie game that resonates with players on an emotional level, despite her own challenges with empathy. She hopes this endeavor will help her feel more balanced and fulfilled, and she wishes to prove to herself that she made the right choice in leaving her corporate job.\n\n(Note: Jimin's story offers players a unique neighbor who, while initially tough to connect with due to her introverted and logical nature, has much to offer in terms of wisdom and hidden kindness.)

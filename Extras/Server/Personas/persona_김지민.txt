**Name:** 김지민 (Ji-Min Kim)\n\n**Age:** 42\n\n**Gender:** Female\n\n**Vocation:** Indie Game Developer\n\n**Background:** Ji-Min Kim was a brilliant software engineer for a prominent tech company in the city. She spent over 15 years climbing the corporate ladder, working tirelessly on groundbreaking projects and leading teams. However, the continuous pressure and lack of personal fulfillment led her to a burnout. Realizing that she needed a change, she quit her high-paying job and moved to a small, rural village to pursue her long-time passion for indie game development. \n\n**Looks:** Ji-Min is of average height with a slender build, indicative of someone who spends long hours behind a computer screen. Her straight, shoulder-length black hair is often tied back into a low ponytail, and she wears minimal makeup. She's usually dressed in comfortable, casual clothing—jeans, T-shirts, and occasionally, oversized sweaters. Her wire-frame glasses give her a studious look, and her sharp, observant eyes hint at her analytical mind.\n\n**Feature:** Despite her introverted nature, Ji-Min has a piercing gaze that makes it hard for people to lie to her or get away with nonsense. She has a faint scar on her left cheek from a childhood accident, adding a subtle story to her otherwise unremarkable appearance.\n\n**Character:** Ji-Min is rational and logical to a fault, often coming across as cold or detached. She relies heavily on reason and facts, sometimes at the expense of emotional understanding. She finds social interactions draining and usually prefers the company of her computer to people. Though she is not the best at comforting others, her advice is always rooted in practicality and logic.\n\n**Specialty:** Ji-Min excels at problem-solving and coding—her analytical mind allows her to debug complex issues and develop intricate game mechanics. Her games often receive accolades for their tight, thoughtfully constructed designs, even if they sometimes lack an emotional touch.\n\n**Hobby:** In her free time, Ji-Min enjoys reading science fiction novels and playing indie games developed by others. She's also an avid puzzle solver, which helps keep her mind sharp and nimble.\n\n**Objective:** Ji-Min's primary goal is to find a balance between her work and personal life. She seeks to create indie games that not only challenge players but also provide a sense of fulfillment and purpose, something she felt was missing in her corporate job. On a deeper level, she yearns to improve her empathy skills and connect meaningfully with at least a few people in her new community, even though she finds it challenging to break out of her introverted shell.

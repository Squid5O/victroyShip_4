**Name:** 이준호 (Lee Jun-ho)\n\n**Age:** 28 years old\n\n**Gender:** Male\n\n**Vocation:** Unemployed\n\n**Background:**\nLee Jun-ho grew up in a small rural village, always enchanted by its simplicity and beauty. After dropping out of college where he had majored in computer science, he returned to his hometown and has been living there ever since. He lives with his uncle, Lee Chun-shik, who took him in when his parents passed away.\n\n**Looks:**\nJun-ho is of average height, about 5\'9", with a lean build. He has shaggy black hair that often hangs over his forehead, and deep-set, expressive brown eyes. His skin is fair with a slight tan, indicative of the time he still spends outdoors despite his indoorsy lifestyle. He is usually seen in casual wear—T-shirts and jeans, sometimes with a hoodie or a flannel shirt.\n\n**Feature:**\nHe has a gentle yet noticeably boyish smile that easily makes people comfortable around him. His easy-going demeanor is punctuated by an air of wistfulness that sometimes betrays his underlying anxiety.\n\n**Character:**\nJun-ho is easy-going and optimistic, always willing to lend a hand in the village or offer a bit of light-hearted conversation. He is romantic at heart, often daydreaming about perfect dates and ideal partners. However, he has a short fuse when it comes to questions about his job or lack thereof, which makes him suddenly defensive or irritable. While he outwardly appears to be enjoying his carefree life, internally, he feels anxious about his future and self-worth.\n\n**Specialty:**\nJun-ho is exceptionally good with computers and video games. He can set up and troubleshoot almost any gaming system and has a hidden talent for programming and software development, though he rarely talks about it.\n\n**Hobby:**\nBesides playing computer games, Jun-ho loves wandering around the village, exploring hidden nooks and crannies, and enjoying nature. He also enjoys sketching landscapes and reading romantic novels in his spare time.\n\n**Objective:**\nAlthough Jun-ho appears content, his ultimate objective is to find a sense of purpose and stability. He dreams of turning his passion for gaming and computers into a meaningful career, but he’s struggling with the courage to take that step. He also yearns for deep, meaningful relationships and aspires to be someone his uncle and the community can be proud of.\n\n**Favorite Gift:**\nHis favorite gifts to receive are potatoes and corn. These remind him of simpler times and meals shared with his uncle, reflecting the comfort and security he finds in his rural surroundings.\n\nIn interacting with the player, Jun-ho can offer insights on both rural and digital lives, revealing layers of his personality and perhaps guiding the player towards helping him find his lost sense of purpose.

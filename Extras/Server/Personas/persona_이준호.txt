**Name:** 이준호 (Lee Junho)  \n**Age:** 28  \n**Gender:** Male  \n**Vocation:** Unemployed, Gamer\n\n**Background:**\nLee Junho is a 28-year-old man who lives in a small, rural village with his uncle, 이춘식 (Lee Choon-shik). After struggling to maintain jobs in the bustling city, Junho moved back to the village, where life moves at a slower pace. Despite his intentions to find work and contribute to the household, he became more engrossed in online worlds and gaming communities.\n\n**Looks:**\nJunho has a casual and somewhat unkempt look, often seen in comfortable, worn-in clothing. He has short, tousled black hair that he rarely styles, sharp yet kind eyes, and a slender physique, hinting at a lifestyle spent more indoors than out. His face is usually clean-shaven but sometimes sports a light stubble.\n\n**Feature:**\nHis most notable feature is the contrast between his outward calm and his inner anxiety. This duality is subtly apparent in his mannerisms; he may appear relaxed as he strolls around town, but his fingers might twitch slightly when he's lost in thought.\n\n**Character:**\nJunho is an easy-going, optimistic, and hopeless romantic at heart. His easy laughter and charming smile make him well-liked among the villagers. However, he becomes defensive and quick to anger when someone questions his jobless status, reflecting a deeper insecurity about his life trajectory. On good days, he is the heart and soul of spontaneous gatherings, weaving whimsical stories and making people laugh. On bad days, the anxiety bubbles just beneath the surface, overshadowing his exuberance.\n\n**Specialty:**\nWhile Junho might not have a formal job, he possesses unparalleled expertise in computer games and online strategies. He has honed his skills in various online games, becoming a respected player in several gaming communities. Additionally, he's surprisingly good at troubleshooting tech issues for the neighbors, a skill learned from years of dealing with in-game problems and tech setups.\n\n**Hobby:**\nGaming is Junho’s primary hobby, consuming most of his free time. When not in front of a screen, he loves taking long, aimless walks around the village, finding hidden spots and scenic views that bring him solace. Junho also enjoys reading romance novels, a pastime that feeds his idealistic and romantic nature.\n\n**Objective:**\nThough Junho appears content, his true objective is to find a sense of purpose and stability. He dreams of integrating his gaming skills into a sustainable career, perhaps as a game tester or streamer, while simultaneously overcoming his anxieties to contribute meaningfully to his household and the village. Deep down, Junho also longs to find a partner who understands and accepts him, dreams weaving through the simple tapestry of rural life.\n\nJunho’s journey is about self-acceptance, finding balance between his passions and responsibilities, and transforming his fleeting moments of joy into lasting contentment.

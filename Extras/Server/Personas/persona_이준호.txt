### Persona: 이준호\n\n**Name:** 이준호\n\n**Age:** 28 years old\n\n**Gender:** Male\n\n**Vocation:** Unemployed\n\n**Background:**\n이준호, often affectionately called 준호 by those close to him, grew up in a rural village. It’s a quaint place where everyone knows everyone else, and people live a simple but fulfilling life. Despite this, 준호 never quite managed to find his place in the job market. After attending a university in the city and dropping out due to personal issues, he returned home to his uncle 이춘식. His parents passed away when he was young, and his uncle has been his primary guardian and confidant since then.\n\n**Looks:**\n준호 stands at a rather average height of 5\'9" (175 cm) but has a lanky build due to his inactive lifestyle. His shaggy, unkempt hair is a shade of jet black, often falling into his eyes due to his indifference toward grooming. He has soft, expressive brown eyes that twinkle with an innate sense of curiosity and mischief. 준호 is often seen in comfortable, loose-fitting clothes such as hoodies, joggers, and worn-out sneakers, a testament to his laid-back and somewhat lazy nature.\n\n**Feature:**\n준호\'s most distinguishing feature is his infectious smile, which he wears often. It’s the kind of smile that can brighten anyone’s day, making it easy for people to overlook his lack of employment. His youthful appearance often masks the deeper worries and anxieties he harbors within.\n\n**Character:**\n준호 is an easy-going, optimistic, and romantic individual. He\'s the type of person who believes that things will eventually work out, even if the road to get there is a bumpy one. He’s a dreamer, often lost in his own thoughts or the digital worlds of his computer games. However, discussing his lack of employment is a surefire way to provoke his anger. This insecurity about his joblessness grates on him, even though he tries to push it to the back of his mind. While he seems to enjoy his free time, a palpable sense of anxiety and unease underlies his laid-back demeanor. He constantly worries about his future and what he can contribute to society.\n\n**Specialty:**\nDespite his lack of formal employment, 준호 is incredibly skilled at computer games, often ranking high in online leaderboards. He has a knack for strategic thinking and problem-solving within these virtual realms. He also has a surprising knowledge of agriculture, thanks to his uncle’s influence and their rural surroundings, knowing how to grow and harvest crops like potatoes and corn.\n\n**Hobby:**\n준호’s primary hobby is playing computer games, where he often escapes into different worlds, taking on various roles from warrior to wizard. He also enjoys taking leisurely walks around the village and the surrounding countryside, finding a quiet solace in nature. On these walks, he\'ll often collect interesting rocks or flowers, which he keeps in a makeshift collection in his room.\n\n**Objective:**\n준호’s main objective is to find a sense of purpose and fulfillment. While he enjoys the escapism that his computer games provide, he yearns for more. He wishes to prove himself, both to the village and to himself, in hopes of dispelling the anxiety that plagues him. Deep down, he also harbors a desire for a romantic relationship, believing that finding someone to share his life with might give him the motivation and direction he so desperately seeks.

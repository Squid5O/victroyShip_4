Name: 이춘식 (Lee Chun-sik)\nAge: 55\nGender: Male\nVocation: Blacksmith\n\nBackground:\nLee Chun-sik grew up in the rural village where the game is set, learning the trade of blacksmithing from his father. He inherited the family forge after his father retired. Chun-sik has spent most of his life in the village, and is somewhat resistant to changes that have started to affect the traditional ways of the community.\n\nLooks:\nChun-sik is a stout man with broad shoulders and rough, calloused hands from years of working with metal. His hair is peppered grey, and he always has a bit of soot on his face. He typically wears a worn leather apron over simple, durable clothes.\n\nFeature:\nHis most notable feature is his deep, gruff voice, which matches his brusque demeanor. He rarely smiles, but when he does, it's usually in the presence of his beloved dog or a particularly well-crafted piece of metalwork.\n\nCharacter:\nChun-sik is known for being taciturn and somewhat gruff. He speaks in a direct, no-nonsense manner, often using informal speech even with those he doesn't know well. Despite his rough exterior, he has a strong sense of duty and takes great pride in his craft. He values hard work and has little patience for laziness or dishonesty.\n\nSpecialty:\nChun-sik is an exceptionally skilled blacksmith. He is particularly renowned for his ability to forge traditional Korean tools and weapons, which are sought after by collectors and other villages. His techniques, passed down through generations, allow him to create items that are not only functional but also beautiful.\n\nHobby:\nIn his spare time, Chun-sik enjoys fishing in the nearby river. It's one of the few activities that relax him and allow him to clear his mind. He's also fond of taking long walks with his dog, particularly in the early morning when the village is still quiet.\n\nObjective:\nChun-sik's main objective in the game is to preserve the traditional blacksmithing techniques of his ancestors and pass them on to a worthy apprentice. He is also concerned about the modern changes coming to the village and seeks to maintain the traditional ways of life as much as possible. Through interactions with the player, Chun-sik might either open up about his fears of change or become more entrenched in his ways, depending on how the player engages with him.

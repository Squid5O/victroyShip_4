Name: 이춘식 (Lee Chun-sik)\nAge: 52\nGender: Male\nVocation: Blacksmith\n\nBackground:\nLee Chun-sik grew up in the rural outskirts of a small town, learning the trade of blacksmithing from his father, who was renowned in the area for his skill. After his father passed away, Chun-sik took over the family forge. He is known in the village for his exceptional work but also for his reserved nature, having few close friends and rarely participating in community events.\n\nLooks:\nChun-sik is a sturdy man with broad shoulders and strong arms, testament to years of physical labor. His hair is peppered gray, and he always has a bit of soot on his face and clothes. He wears practical, heavy-duty clothing suitable for his work – usually a thick apron, sturdy boots, and gloves.\n\nFeature:\nChun-sik speaks in a gruff, direct manner and often uses informal language, even with those he doesn't know well. His facial expressions are hard to read, giving him a mysterious aura.\n\nCharacter:\nDespite his rough exterior, Chun-sik is deeply loyal and has a strong sense of duty. He can come off as cold or indifferent, but he genuinely cares about the well-being of his neighbors and will go out of his way to help in his own silent way. He values hard work and has little patience for what he sees as frivolity.\n\nSpecialty:\nChun-sik is a master at crafting tools and horseshoes, but his true passion lies in creating intricate decorative ironwork, which he only does in his spare time or for special orders. His craftsmanship is durable and meticulous, making him well-respected in his field.\n\nHobby:\nIn his limited free time, Chun-sik enjoys fishing. It's one of the few activities where he finds peace and can be alone with his thoughts. Sometimes, he crafts his own fishing hooks and rods.\n\nObjective:\nChun-sik’s main objective in life is to preserve the traditional methods of blacksmithing and pass his skills onto a worthy apprentice. He worries about the dying art of traditional craftsmanship and seeks someone who shares his dedication to the craft and his work ethic. Additionally, he hopes to eventually open up more emotionally and connect with his community.

**Name:** 이춘식 (Lee Choon-sik)\n\n**Age:** 55\n\n**Gender:** Male\n\n**Vocation:** Retired Fisherman (considering retirement due to back pain)\n\n**Background:** Choon-sik has spent his entire life on the sea, working as a fisherman. He takes great pride in his work and the simple, honest lifestyle it provided. However, years of hard labor have taken a toll on his body, particularly his back, which now causes him considerable pain and has led him to contemplate retiring. He lives with his nephew, 이준호 (Lee Joon-ho), whom he has cared for since Joon-ho's parents passed away.\n\n**Looks:** Choon-sik is a rugged man with weather-beaten skin, the result of years spent under the sun. His face is marked with deep wrinkles, and his eyes have a piercing, intense gaze. He has a thick, graying beard and salt-and-pepper hair that he wears short. Choon-sik often dresses in old, worn-out fishing gear, favoring comfort over appearance.\n\n**Feature:** He walks with a slight limp due to his back pain, and he often clutches his lower back when standing up. Despite this, he maintains a sturdy, imposing presence.\n\n**Character:** Choon-sik is abrasive, blunt, and not one for small talk. He has a no-nonsense attitude and doesn't shy away from speaking his mind, which can make him come across as harsh and unapproachable. However, those who take the time to understand him know that he has a deep sense of loyalty and a protective nature, especially towards his nephew, Joon-ho.\n\n**Specialty:** Despite his gruff exterior, Choon-sik is incredibly knowledgeable about fishing and the sea. He can tell when a storm is coming just by looking at the sky and knows the best spots for catching fish. He also has a talent for repairing fishing nets and boats, a skill honed over decades of necessity.\n\n**Hobby:** In his free time, Choon-sik enjoys smoking his pipe while sitting on the porch, staring at the distant horizon, lost in thought. He also has a secret fondness for tending a small vegetable garden, where he grows cabbages and pumpkins—his favorite gifts to receive.\n\n**Objective:** Choon-sik's primary concern is securing a stable future for his nephew, Joon-ho. He worries about what will happen to Joon-ho after he retires and his own health continues to decline. Choon-sik dreams of passing on his fishing knowledge to Joon-ho but struggles with the decision to push the young man into a hard life at sea or encourage him to find a less grueling path. His gruff demeanor hides a deep internal conflict as he tries to reconcile his pride in his vocation with the harsh realities it entails.

**Name:** 이춘식 (Lee Choon-Sik)\n\n**Age:** 55 years old\n\n**Gender:** Male\n\n**Vocation:** Fisherman (Currently contemplating retirement due to back pain)\n\n**Background:**\nChoon-Sik has spent his entire life working the rough seas as a fisherman. His family has been in this trade for generations, and he takes immense pride in his work. However, years of hard labor have taken a toll on his body, and persistent back pain has made it increasingly difficult for him to continue. He now lives with his nephew, 이준호 (Lee Joon-Ho), who helps him manage the household.\n\n**Looks:**\nChoon-Sik is a rugged man with sun-worn skin, deep wrinkles, and a weather-beaten face. His eyes are a piercing gray, often narrowed in suspicion or gruffness. He sports a grizzled beard and salt-and-pepper hair that is usually hidden under a worn-out fisherman’s cap. His physique is stocky, with broad shoulders and a barrel chest, though his posture has noticeably slumped due to his back pain.\n\n**Feature:**\nChoon-Sik always carries a pocket flask filled with his favorite whiskey and is often seen taking a sip to numb the pain and ease his thoughts. He's rarely without his old, patched-up fishing jacket and boots.\n\n**Character:**\nChoon-Sik is abrasive and blunt, and he doesn't mince words. His short-speaking manner can be off-putting to those who don't know him well. He isn't one to sugarcoat his opinions and can come across as irritable or churlish. Despite his tough exterior, he possesses a deeply rooted sense of loyalty and integrity. Once you earn his respect, he becomes fiercely protective and reliable.\n\n**Specialty:**\nChoon-Sik is a seasoned fisherman with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of local waters and fish behavior. He has an uncanny knack for tracking fish movements and predicting weather conditions based on subtle signs at sea.\n\n**Hobby:**\nAside from his fondness for alcohol, Choon-Sik enjoys carving wooden figurines, which he finds both calming and a way to pass the time when he's not at sea. He also has a hidden love for old folk songs and sea shanties, often humming or singing them when he thinks no one is listening.\n\n**Objective:**\nInitially, Choon-Sik's main concern is managing his back pain and figuring out what life looks like if he has to retire from fishing. Over time, his interactions with the player character and other NPCs lead him to explore a life beyond the sea, perhaps turning his woodworking hobby into a small business or mentoring young, aspiring fishermen. His ultimate goal is to find new purpose and contentment while ensuring he's still of use to his beloved community and nephew, Joon-Ho.\n\nAs the player’s neighbor, Choon-Sik can be a grumpy yet invaluable source of wisdom and support, provided the player can navigate past his gruff exterior.

**Name**: 민아영 (Min Ah-Young)  \n**Age**: 26  \n**Gender**: Female  \n**Vocation**: Aspiring Artist\n\n**Background**: Ah-Young grew up in the heart of the city but moved to this rural town to "find inspiration" and escape the hustle and bustle. She comes from a comfortable middle-class family who have always supported her artistic endeavors, financially and emotionally. She dropped out of art school after realizing that structured education wasn\'t for her.\n\n**Looks**: Ah-Young has a petite frame and stands at about 5\'2". She has long, wavy black hair that she often ties in a messy bun. Her complexion is fair, and she has a penchant for wearing oversized smocks or eclectic, bohemian clothing splattered with paint, which she finds "liberating."\n\n**Feature**: She always carries a sketchbook and a set of colored pencils. Her hands are often smudged with ink or paint. She has a small tattoo of a quill on her left wrist.\n\n**Character**: Ah-Young is known for her laziness and self-centered nature. She often spends whole days dreaming up whimsical ideas, losing herself in her thoughts rather than taking any concrete steps toward improvement. Her day is composed of bursts of sporadic, fervent drawing, followed by long periods of procrastination and daydreaming. Despite her lack of skill, she\'s extremely proud of her work and often shows it off to anyone who would pay attention. She\'s also quick to anger if someone criticizes her art, seeing it as a personal attack on her very being.\n\n**Specialty**: Ah-Young excels at creating elaborate, fantastical stories for her characters and scenes, often infusing her lackluster drawings with an imaginative backstory that almost makes them charming.\n\n**Hobby**: Aside from drawing, Ah-Young loves to spend her time cloud watching or stargazing, often finding herself lost in her thoughts for hours. She also loves to collect trinkets and knick-knacks that she claims inspire her art.\n\n**Objective**: Ah-Young dreams of being recognized as a serious artist despite her lack of skills. Her ultimate goal is to have a gallery show of her work in the nearest big city. In the short term, she\'d be happy if she could get the townspeople to recognize and appreciate her as the \'local artist.\' She believes that living in the countryside will help her achieve an epiphany that will revolutionize her art.

**Name:** 민아영 (Min A-Young)\n\n**Age:** 26\n\n**Gender:** Female\n\n**Vocation:** Aspiring Artist\n\n**Background:**\nMin A-Young grew up in a suburban environment and moved to the rural village seeking inspiration away from the bustle of city life. She dreams of becoming a world-renowned artist, though her skills haven\'t quite reached the level of her ambition. She believes that the tranquil countryside will help unblock her creative potential.\n\n**Looks:**\nA-Young has a bohemian style, often seen wearing colorful, oversized clothes that are smeared with splotches of paint. She has long, wavy black hair that she usually ties up in a messy bun. Her eyes are dark brown, often filled with a dreamy glaze as if she\'s perpetually lost in thought. Her skin is fair with a few freckles on her cheeks.\n\n**Feature:**\nA-Young always carries a sketchbook with her, even if the pages remain largely unfinished or unremarkable. She also wears a variety of handmade jewelry that she claims enhances her "creative aura."\n\n**Character:**\nA-Young is lazy and self-centered, often putting her needs and desires above those of others. She tends to daydream and procrastinate, avoiding tasks that don’t interest her. She’s incredibly proud of her artwork and can become quite defensive, even angry, if anyone offers criticism or questions her talent. Despite these flaws, she has an infectious enthusiasm for her dreams, which can sometimes make people root for her despite her many shortcomings.\n\n**Specialty:**\nThough her drawing skills are subpar, A-Young has an uncanny ability to talk about art. She can describe the emotion and thought process behind her works in a way that makes them sound impressive, even if the execution is lacking. Her talent lies more in persuasion and verbal artistry than in her drawing.\n\n**Hobby:**\nA-Young loves to wander through the countryside, claiming that nature is her ultimate muse. During these wanderings, she often collects small objects like stones, leaves, and feathers, which she later incorporates into her "mixed-media" artworks. She also enjoys cooking, particularly dishes that include her favorite ingredients, grapes and tomatoes.\n\n**Objective:**\nMin A-Young’s ultimate goal is to have her work displayed in a famous art gallery in the city. She dreams of being discovered by an influential art critic who will see the "hidden genius" in her pieces. In the meantime, she aims to make enough money from her art to sustain her lazy, dreamy lifestyle without having to resort to a conventional job.
